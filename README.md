# 👨‍💻 Machine Learning algorithms from scratch

This is library of most known and often used Machine Learning algorithms. All algorithms
are coded in OOP style with testing sections at the end. 

📌 KMeans clustering 

📌 Naive Bayes 

📌 Decision Tree and Random Forest

## Tech Stack

**Programming Language:** Python 🐍

**Environment:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

**Libraries:** Numpy, Collections and Scikit-Learn datasets for testing.

## How to use

All files include algorithms coded in OOP and tests at the end. If you want classes only - feel free to comment testing section.

## Testing results
 
✅ Naive Bayes: Random 1000 samples, 10 features, 2 classes -> 88% accuracy.

✅ Decision Tree: Breast cancer dataset -> 93.9% accuracy

✅ Random Forest: Breast cancer dataset -> 92.9% accuracy
